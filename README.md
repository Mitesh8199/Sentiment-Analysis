# Sentiment-Analysis

In this Project I have built a machine Learning model which can predict the sentiment of a tweet and tell whether the tweet is positive or Negative.
### Steps Involved:
1. Data Upload
2. Data Preprocessing
  - Removal of Punctuations
  - Removal of Stop Words
  - Normalisation
3. Created a Data Pipeline to fit the Text data transformer and the machine learning algorithm 
4. Model evaluation
5. Created a funtion in which more machine learning algorithms are added to check which model gives highest performamce
6. Model Evaluation.

Please check the Jupyter Notebook File to get a better Understanding.
